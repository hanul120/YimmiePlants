<p>Audrey Yim founded Yimmie Plants in 2022. Passionate for nurturing plants and flowers at a young age, Audrey began to share with others about this passion through her personal Instagram account via #YimmiePlants. After the overwhelming positive responses to this hashtag, Audrey ultimately created a separate Instagram account @YimmiePlants and currently posts about trending plants, along with her many collections of plants and flowers, including the dahlia tuber.</p> 

<p>Audrey volunteers her time as the church gardener for her home church, Renewal Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She houses her many David Austen roses, dahlias, among other plants and flowers. </p>
