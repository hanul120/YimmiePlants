<p>Audrey Yim founded Yimmie Plants in 2022. Passionate for nurturing plants and flowers at a young age, Audrey began to share with others about this passion through her personal Instagram account via #YimmiePlants. After the overwhelming positive responses to this hashtag, Audrey ultimately created a separate Instagram account @YimmiePlants and currently posts about trending plants, along with her many collections of plants and flowers, including the dahlia tuber.
